# Kb
(Pronounced "kay flat")

Kb is a personal project making a bytecode interpreter for my own programming language using Robert Nystrom's book, Crafting Interpreters, but translating into more object-oriented C++ for a little extra challenge (and because I just like C++ more).
It is my first time coding in a Linux environment, which also means it's my first time using CLion and CMake.
